### Introduction

Prior to 1871, the United States viewed indigenous nations as both a threat and hinderance to American westward expansion. President Andrew Jackson and others asserted that a policy of Indian removal opened up land for American expansion and provided indigenous nations with an opportunity to create a better life for themselves.  However, others, such as General Benjamin Alvord, argued that the United States should fulfill their treaty obligations and not treat the Indians as “hostiles.”  These tensions exacerbated conflicts between American indigenous tribes and Euro-American settlers.  During 1855 to 1871, the United States promoted an Americanized approach to Indian treaties, centered around their assumptions about U.S.-Indian relations, which exacerbated tensions between Indian resistance and American subjugation.[^1]
